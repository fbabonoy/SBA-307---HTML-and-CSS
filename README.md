# Maybury Stables Website

This project showcases a simple yet elegant web page for Maybury Stables, a trail-riding facility and equestrian summer camp located in Maybury State Park. The website highlights the stables' services, including trail rides for riders of all skill levels, summer camp experiences, and upcoming events. It features a clean layout with engaging visuals, user-friendly navigation, and responsive design, all powered by HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.

The project includes a navbar with dropdown menus for seamless navigation between pages such as "Home," "About," "Services," and "Log In." The main sections showcase welcoming banners, detailed information about the stables, and vibrant images to engage visitors. Additionally, the footer provides information about online payments and cancellation policies. Feel free to explore and adapt this project to fit your needs!
